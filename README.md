Customers see an overview of all the room's status if rooms are booked by other customers or not.
If a customer clicked on a room customer can see full details about that room like whether it is an AC room or not, if it has attached bathrooms, the number of beds etc. 
Then also customers can see comments of past users about that room and resort service. 
Anyway if it is an already booked room a new customer can’t book it. But any user can see the room features.
One user can select more than one room at one time.
Then they can select the time duration to selected rooms. The date must not far from a week from the reserved date.
Then they can make payments for the rooms which they selected and reserved for a particular time duration. 
System admin can see all the room details and current user details who reserve the room and also see all payment details.
